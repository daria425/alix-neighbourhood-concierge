Collective study and exploration has remained the bedrock of Empirical\u2019s creative process and has seen the band assimilate influences from right across the rich history of jazz. While oblique harmonies, translucent textures and jagged, quick shifting rhythms are the signposts of Empirical\u2019s musical territory, the band has not been afraid to explore other musical realms. Alongside their ceaselessly fearless creative fervour, Empirical have succeeded in establishing an instantly recognisable group sound that is rife with raw energy and roiling emotion.

Born in Lisbon, Portugal, he began playing piano at age nine and, inspired by the Brazilian music he was surrounded by at home, picked up a guitar at age 12. Under the tutelage of renowned Portuguese guitarist Mario Delgado, he began turning to the sounds of jazz and improvised music. He moved to London in 2003 to study at Middlesex University with Nikki Iles, Chris Batchelor and Stuart Hall and in 2007 he graduated with a first-class honours degree in Music (Jazz Performance).

On the border between Germany and Poland, the shadow of fascism is inching closer. Hitler has a plan: stage a violent Polish attack on a German-speaking radio station, and use the attack to justify a Nazi invasion. But how do you pull off an act of deception designed to keep the UK from entering into a World War?\r German farmer Franciszek Honiok finds himself arrested and imprisoned in a jail cell on the border. Alongside him are two prisoners from Dachau: a Jewish philosopher and a German janitor. As the mission looms closer and tensions build, the three men must wrestle with an impossible unknown. Can they survive a plan much bigger than themselves? And are they the \u2018canned goods\u2019 their captors keep discussing?\r Making its London premiere after several critically acclaimed US runs, Canned Goods tells the gripping true story of a little-known \u2013 but pivotal \u2013 moment in history.
