On the border between Germany and Poland, the shadow of fascism is inching closer. Hitler has a plan: stage a violent Polish attack on a German-speaking radio station, and use the attack to justify a Nazi invasion. But how do you pull off an act of deception designed to keep the UK from entering into a World War?\r German farmer Franciszek Honiok finds himself arrested and imprisoned in a jail cell on the border. Alongside him are two prisoners from Dachau: a Jewish philosopher and a German janitor. As the mission looms closer and tensions build, the three men must wrestle with an impossible unknown. Can they survive a plan much bigger than themselves? And are they the \u2018canned goods\u2019 their captors keep discussing?\r Making its London premiere after several critically acclaimed US runs, Canned Goods tells the gripping true story of a little-known \u2013 but pivotal \u2013 moment in history. Still relevant today, Erik Kahn\u2019s edge-of-your seat thriller explores the knife edge of propaganda, \u2018fake news\u2019 and how those in power bend the truth for their own agenda.\n\n\n\n\n",

Following the sell-out success of Gaia and Museum of the Moon, Mars will complete the trilogy of Jerram\u2019s out-of-this-world installations at the iconic Old Royal Naval College.\r Measuring seven metres in diameter, this spellbinding artwork features detailed NASA imagery of the Martian surface recreated to scale. Slowly rotating against the spectacular backdrop of the Painted Hall, this unique pairing will bring two breathtaking works of art together, merging science with history, myth and allegory.\r \u201cMars follows on from my other astronomical artworks Museum of the Moon and Gaia presented in the awe-inspiring Painted Hall and allows a close encounter with the Martian planet. I hope that visitors will feel transported to its inhospitable desert wasteland and in comparison, really value our life on Earth.\u201d \u2013 Luke Jerram.\n\n\n\n\n",

The process of studying together is really what brought us together, and we just carried on doing it\u201d recalls Tom Farmer. Collective study and exploration has remained the bedrock of Empirical\u2019s creative process and has seen the band assimilate influences from right across the rich history of jazz. While oblique harmonies, translucent textures and jagged, quick shifting rhythms are the signposts of Empirical\u2019s musical territory, the band has not been afraid to explore other musical realms. Alongside their ceaselessly fearless creative fervour, Empirical have succeeded in establishing an instantly recognisable group sound that is rife with raw energy and roiling emotion. Despite the intellectualism often ascribed to jazz, for Empirical, it\u2019s ultimately all about moving, rather than impressing, their audience. \r PEDRO VELASCO @pedrovelascomusic\rPedro Velasco is a London-based guitarist who specialises in improvised music. Born in Lisbon, Portugal, he began playing piano at age nine and, inspired by the Brazilian music he was surrounded by at home, picked up a guitar at age 12. Under the tutelage of renowned Portuguese guitarist Mario Delgado, he began turning to the sounds of jazz and improvised music. He moved to London in 2003 to study at Middlesex University with Nikki Iles, Chris Batchelor and Stuart Hall and in 2007 he graduated with a first-class honours degree in Music (Jazz Performance). He performs prolifically across the UK, and Europe with several projects including Harry Christelis and Pedro Velasco duo who recently released their debut album Scribbling to critical acclaim.\n\n\n\n\n",

Plant Power marks their propagation into the hustle and bustle of an office environment. \r Showcasing twelve works including a painting to introduce a new body of work dedicated to the maritime realm, groups of sensual cyborgs and symbiotic totems are huddled in opposite corners, exchanging water cooler stories under the watchful gaze of their mutant supervisors, whose predatory and fallible characteristics serve as reminders of the effects of climate change on all life-forms.\r Fusing organic and synthetic materials into intriguing monuments to human-plant interconnectivity, Trevorah merges eco-feminist theory with subtle humour to encourage reflection and reassurance\n\n\n\n\n",

People who have already joined the choir, who hail from Bromley and further afield in Kent come from all walks of life and most had no singing experience or ever thought their singing journey would ever take them on TV or radio (not compulsory :-) ). Once you join the choir you will find you learn the songs by rote from a brilliant set of resources and you will be amazed how quickly you go from 'not sure' to 'performance ready'. The songs are uniquely arranged by Rock Choir founder Caroline Redman Lusher to make songs easy to sing yet still challenge you in places.\r You've probably heard us singing in and around Kent, or seen one of our many TV appearances, and never thought you'd have to courage to get up on stage and sing! But the unique teaching methods at the Bromley Rock Choir, along with no need to audition or read music, mean that we are accessible to all. Come along and try us out for FREE at a taster session, and experience singing with your local 'exceptional' Rock Choir for yourself.\r Here is a quote about our choir - 'I joined Rock Choir after being made redundant and being out of work for a year, so was feeling fairly low. Immediately I was greeted like an old friend and made to feel welcome. Since then I have gone on to meet new friends, have a great time every week and culminating to doing a solo at a local festival. If you'd have said to me a year ago I'd have the confidence to not only sing in front of people, but do a solo, I'd have told you not to be so silly. Rock Choir has become a v important part of my life, for the better.' - Alex (Rock Choir member)\r Rock Choir is a winner of the Red Ribbon 'Big Heart' Award. and holds 1 former and 2 current Guinness World Records. The choir is also credited with single handedly starting t\n\n\n\n\n",
