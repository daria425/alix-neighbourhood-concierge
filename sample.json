Restless but rhapsodic, its joyous evocation of nature has been described as \u201ccontemporary in language but sensuously easy on the ear\u201d. Brimming with virtuosity, it is an ideal fit for Collins, acclaimed as \u201cone of the best clarinettists walking the planet\u201d by The Times.\r Music by Ravel book-ends the programme, which opens with Rapsodie espagnole (1907-08), one \rof the composer\u2019s first major works for orchestra. Drawing on his Basque heritage, the colourful \rfour-movement piece moves from the stillness of night to Spanish dances and a dazzling fiesta.\r Ravel described La valse (1919-20) \u2013 originally conceived as a ballet \u2013 as a depiction of waltzing \rcouples in an imperial court, initially seen through whirling clouds. Beginning with kaleidoscopic \rfragments of melodies, this popular work builds inexorably to a tumultuous, thrilling finale.\r Music director Russell Keable also leads the orchestra in a performance of Prokofiev\u2019s Lieutenant \rKij\u00e9 (1933-34). The composer viewed his first film score \u2013 accompanying a satire on Russian royalty \r\u2013 as an opportunity to adopt a more accessible style, and the resulting five-movement suite is one\rof his most popular works.\r Described as \u201cone of the very best amateur groups in the country\u201d by Classical Music magazine, \rKSO has been hailed by Classical Source for \u201cputting on bold, adventurous programmes that few \rof the \u2018big five\u2019 in London would either think of or get away with\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n",
